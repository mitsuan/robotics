Non-holonomic drive robots have constrained motion along a single axis at a particular instant. Such robots don't have the freedom to travel in any desired direction or move in a direction and simultaneously rotate about its own axis. Therefore they tend to be slow for movement in a 2D plane in an indoor environment in comparision to holonomic drive robots viz robots with omni directional drive. Omni drive robots have 3 degrees of freedom viz translatory motion along: x- axis, y-axis and rotational motion along the z-axis. This is possible due to the usage of special type of wheels like: omni wheels, mecanum wheels etc. These robots have the ability to move in any direction as well as rotate about its own axis simultaneously and therefore take minimum time to travel from one point to another. The motion of such robots is defined by the resultant of the vector
