# Problem Statement:
The theme was Cross A Crater and was based on the Mars mission of ISRO. The complete problem statement is given the pdf-'Problem_statement_eyantra_2017'.

## Overview of solution 

   According to the problem statement our robot had gone to a location (the boulder region)away from the base station. While returning it encountered two bridges with cavities. One of the bridge also had some obstacles. The robot had to fill the cavities present in the bridge using some boulders present in the boulder region. And, then cross the bridge to reach the base station. The complete arena is monitored using an overhead camera connected to a pc, which acts as a satellite. A python code processes the image of the arena and sends the required information to the robot. The robot accordingly travels to the boulders, picks them up and fills the cavities. After filling up the cavities the robot reaches the base station, completing the problem statement.
